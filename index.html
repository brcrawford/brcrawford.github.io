       <h4>Letter of Introduction</h4>
<p>Dear Reader,</p>

<p>I am seeking a position with your company. At your convenience, I would love to discuss opportunities and my possible candidacy with you. You can find my resume attached further down.</p>

<p>While I am only now entering the IT world I have worked diligently in my studies and have put in ample effort on all my projects.  During my time in the IT program I have learned multiple computer languages and have met all my deadlines in a timely manner.  I worked as Team Lead and Project Manager on my last project and have experience with both outside of the classroom as well. </p>

<p>I have broad experience with various software and hardware outside of college. Throughout my life I have always been fascinated by technology and love to tinker with any gadget I can get my hands on.  I&#39;m currently working with my first Raspberry Pi system to build an emulation station in my living room which is my first time seriously working with Linux.  I also have experience with a wide range of Windows based software, Aloha systems, Square software, and working on more Google certifications to go with my Analytics cert.</p>


<p>Outside of the IT field I have worked in many different industries ranging from baking to over a year spent working in the oil fields of North Dakota.  I am able to keep a level head in high tension situations and have a decade of customer service experience which has greatly improved my presentation skills..  Punctual and dependable I have always made for a strong member of the team no matter which position I happen to be in at the time.</p> 

<p>In a year I will have completed a B.A. in E-Commerce with and an Associate in General Technology and an Associate of Art. I currently work full-time as a waiter and bartender at South on Main Restaurant, having to manage my time wisely in order to meet project deadlines and maintain a high gpa with a full-time class load.</p>

<p>I believe that I have the broad range of experience, skills, IT knowledge, personal commitment, and professional track record to help you meet your goals.  I would greatly appreciate the opportunity to become a valuable member of your team.</p>

<p> Feel free to contact me anytime at (501) 413-0353 or brcrawford@ualr.edu</p>

<p>Thank you for your consideration,</p>

<p>Brandon Crawford<br>

 It uses a variety of functions to call the information on the Report Sheet from all of the others.  Functions such as the =SUMIFS on the first page are over 50 characters long and pull data from every page. The Sheet also contains SUM, RANK, INDEX, SORT, and Charts.  It is able to cross reference all the information in order to file a rank and usage report for any customer in the drop-down list.  Easily the most advanced Excel file I&#39ve ever had to create.</details>

The Jewelry Stock uses a combination of: SUM, SUMIF, SUMIFS, SUMPRODUCT, AVERAGE, AVERAGEIF, MIN, MAX, RANK, IFS, and SPARKLINE to create the information presented on Sheet1.

It uses IF/ELSE statements to set a logic path that lets users submit a quality report on their recent visit, using POST to send the information to the database.  Not knowing any JS before this made it quite difficult to complete, but it did get me in the habit of de-bugging as I go instead of typing all the code only to have it break due to something bizarre in the mix.</details>

Using AJAX it is able to run the query asynchronously without interfering with the display and behavior of the site and can be used multiple times without reloading the page.  There is also a pop-up alert window that triggers on landing to let the user know to enter the first operand and a warning alerting the user that the operand has to be a valid number.</details>

The user must enter valid numbers, in both fields, to get the hypotenuse.  If the user does something else Then they trip one of the validate gates and cannot move forward.</details>

This webpage documents all the blog entries I made during that time and also uses tags to organize the posts into various categories depending on what the assignment was.  Learning the skills needed to give presentations and present my information in an organized manner were just as important as the code behind the scene.</details>

 Depending on the type of person their approach to a problem can be very different; for example I prefer a pragmatic and decisive solution to a problem while others may prefer to see all the possible angles and consider all outcomes before making a decision.</details>

            <img class="img-fluid img-thumbnail" src="img/thumb12.jpg" alt="Capstone Project: Community Legal Access">Capstone Project:<br>Community Legal Access<details><summary>Read More</summary>The capstone project was the finale of the ITEC program.  My team was tasked with creating a website from scratch for a local non-profit organization.  Working as Team Lead I was able to meet the client&#39;s needs while also finding a middle ground between their wants and their reality.  My team built a static Wordpress site for potential users and other lawyers to get in contact with Community Legal Access.  CLA also wanted the site to be easy to use and navigate for visitors which; We accomplished this by using a theme and altering the code to make the pages more grid based and put as much information on the landing page as possible.  Overall the website was a success and the client was happy with the end product.  However, I would say that the biggest lesson taken away from this project wasn&#39;t in the building of the website but in the interacting with clients and teammates.  As Team Lead I acted as middle man between the client and my team, often having to decide on the spot whether an idea was plausible within our time frame or abilities.  Working with clients who were not computer literate also made for a lot of back and forth to find the correct answers to their problems.  A lesson learned after the work was done in many instances.  While frustrating at times it was a great learning experience and a taste of how projects go outside of the classroom.</details>
